**Developed and Maintained by AI & Robotics Society, MTA**
#### General Purpose Robotics Framework (Codename: RoboCore)

The Robotics Framework project provides a versatile and comprehensive solution applicable to various robotic platforms. It integrates mathematics, physics, and computer science, offering a practical application in live hardware scenarios.

#### Modules:

1. **Visual Detection of Objects Module (Codename: VisionProbe)**
    - **Objective:** Implement visual object detection for robotic platforms.
2. **Detection of Potential Obstacles Module (Codename: ObstacleGuard)**
    - **Objective:** Hybrid approach with additional sensors as sub-modules for obstacle detection.
3. **Inertia State Analysis Module (Codename: InertiaSense)**
    - **Objective:**
        - Stores and analyzes the robot's current inertia state.
        - Assesses position relative to a reference, upright status, and return to the default position.

#### Disciplinary Integration
This project offers a practical application that integrates mathematics, physics, and computer science, providing a holistic learning and application experience.

#### Initial Implementation
The framework can be initially applied to drones or RC cars for performing tricks and self-adjustments.
#### Vision
To create a flexible and adaptable robotics framework with extensive use cases, fostering innovation in the field.

#### Language of Implementation
**Python** will be the primary language used for all Modules in the project.
